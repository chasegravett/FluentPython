# Going through Luciano Ramalho's "Fluent Python"

A github repo for keeping track of the lessons learned while I deep-dive into more advanced pythonic concepts and clean-code practices

## Why?

I have been learning Python and using it in personal projects for about a year now.
While I enjoy the language and probably understand it most deeply out of any of the languages I use, I know there is so much Python (and, in a general sense, programming in general) has to offer than what I currently utilize efficiently.
In the Preface of this book, Ramalho states that it is the easy-to-learn nature of Python that leads many programmers to "leverage only a fraction of its powerful features"
I aspire to make my way to the other end of the bell curve
